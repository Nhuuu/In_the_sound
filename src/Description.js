      <p >The crippled Salmon population in the Puget Sound area has rippling effects across the entire region that include environmental, economic and recreational concerns. </p>
      <p>Many people rely on the salmon for their economic livelihood and salmon is also a keystone species of our local ecosystems providing food for a plethora of other wildlife species. If we don’t work together to help restore habitats and replenish the population we’ll see the devastating effect that a lack of salmon will have on our communities. 
      </p>
      <p>We’d love for you to get involved and learn more about what we can do to help save our salmon!</p>
